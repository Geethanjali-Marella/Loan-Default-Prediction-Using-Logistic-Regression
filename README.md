# Loan-Default-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression

This project involved analyzing a dataset of over 687,000 loan records with 27 features to identify patterns and predict loan default probabilities. Key steps included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and implementing logistic regression models using both Scikit-learn and Statsmodels. Insights such as correlations, grade-wise loan performance, and influential features were derived to aid decision-making for financial institutions.
